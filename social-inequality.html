			<h1 id ="introduction"> Introduction </h1>
			<p>In the past decades, social inequality has been a hot topic in American political environment. There are always multiple sided arguments where some argue for greater equality, some resist the idea of approaching absolute equality, and some believe the inequality problem is not as pathetic as one perceived. The lack of consensus among individuals from the society contributes to the status quo of social inequality, and it has barely shown progress of improvement, especially looking at the economic realm. As of 2013 statistics, the data indicates Americans who live in poverty “grew from 32 million to 44 million” along with the increased participation of government welfare programs (DeSante, 2013). Due to this persistence, many people’s current living situations and their mental states are being affected negatively. For instance, some studies show countries with greater social inequality are correlated to their bad performance on tackling health and social problems, like teenage birth, crime rates and drug abuse.<a href ="#reference" style="color:blue">[13]</a></p>
			<p>One goal of the research paper is to examine the reasoning behind supporting social inequality when the issue is obviously impacting the society in a negative way. A common argument to support a certain extent of social inequality is that absolute equality will reduce individuals’ motivations and their overall performance due to the absence of social mobility, which can harm the society’s economic growth. However, after a series of literature reviews, the findings illustrate there are much more psychological reasons that explain individuals’ motives to support social inequality, both implicitly and explicitly. The findings include many individuals tend to have a misperception by categorizing some “bad'' characteristic traits to people who have lower social standing; people’s likelihood to justify the system they are situated in; and self interest is a critical factor that frames people’s relative position in the social inequality issue. These psychological elements create a robust obstacle that prevent the state from coming up with an effective solution for the issues related to social inequality. In fact, the society is simply preserving the current status quo as demanded.</p>
			<p>As mentioned above, the persistence of social inequality problem may harm society. Thus, it’s important to suggest potential call to actions (CTA) regarding changing some people’s attitude toward inequality with the hope to break through the stagnation of the problem. Establishing from similar research conducted by Cislaghi et al., one effective CTA is leveraging on the powerfulness of “organized diffusion”,<a href ="#reference" style="color:blue">[2]</a> where the state creates both awareness and informative programs to gradually alter social norms - starting within the inner community and diffusing it toward the broader society to discuss how social inequality is affecting the country’s growth and people’s lives negatively. The objective of the informative programs is to raise people’s awareness of acquiring the correct message about social inequality, which allows people to reconsider and reevaluate the mismatch between their perception about social inequality and the reality present in the state. To reduce the behavior of system justification and align with people’s personal self interest, it is necessary to reframe people’s underlying perspectives to the mindset, like tackling issues related to social inequality is actually doing good to society and to their personal wealth. The effectiveness of normative reframing will be further elaborate by analyzing the case study of how environmental advocates aim to tackle climate change problems by reframing the societal norms and people’s faulty beliefs.</p>
			<h1 id ="finding"> Findings </h1>
			<h6>Misperception: Negative Social Stigma of the Poor</h6>
			<p>Some advantaged individuals who support a certain extent of social inequality have a difficult time to empathize with poor people’s circumstances because they have not gone through the experience of living through poverty themselves; thus, they rely on the external factors, including their immediate community and the media to obtain a brief knowledge about the poor. Unfortunately, these external factors are relatively less credible to obtain the correct image of what the poor goes through in their daily lives. For instance, it is important to recognize the phenomenon that advantaged individuals’ immediate community tend to cluster around similar social status and have similar beliefs. This cluster generates ignorance among the advantaged community because most individuals in this community are “insulated from and do not know poor people” (Lott, 2002). With the lack of first hand experience of knowing the poor people’s lifestyle as a result of cognitive distancing, the essential platform these advantaged individuals rely on is the media.</p>
			<p>Yet, the media platform also offers a set of untrustworthy information just like the immediate community, which ultimately also augments the faulty belief that poverty is due to individual failure along with various negative characteristic traits attached to the poor people, like “lazy” and “lack initiative”. One study emphasizes how the media establishes a misleading illustration that the majority of society falls in the “middle class” region by highlighting the good performance of the current market and “downplaying economic insecurity” (Bullock et al., 2001). Building off from how the media portrays poverty as a rare instance that only happens to those who lack effort and lack motivation to gain a higher social standing, it is unlikely for the advantaged individuals to develop an empathetic understanding of recognizing poverty’s vicious cycle is driven by system failure. And they are unlikely to support an absolute equal society because such society means the effortless individuals will not be punished. Some are fear that the consequence of tackling social inequality might cause meritocracy to fall apart, where ambitious and hard-working individuals are no longer rewarded with a higher social status and greater wealth relatively. The fear is derived from one of the fundamental values many Americans held: fairness (Tanner, 2016). To summarize, there is an overall tendency to believe that both success and failure are due to the individual's effort and effortlessness respectively, and not by luck and or privilege.</p>
			<p> Obviously, this section does not aim to argue hard-working individuals should not be rewarded; instead, it attempts to bring attention to the scale of “working hard” may not be equivalent across classes and races due to a form of stereotype mentioned above: advantaged individuals intrinsically distance themselves away from the poor. For example, according to DeSante (2013), society has a filtered lens that defines what’s considered to be “hard-work” and “lazy” in accordance to one’s racial background, where “whites gain more for the same level of effort, and blacks are punished more severely for the same level of ‘laziness’”. Here, the sense of fairness falls apart. One potential explanation for individuals not recognizing this issue upfront is due to the lack of transparency the media platform offered. Oftentimes, the media overgeneralizes an individuals’ behavior and effort based on a specific group they belong to. It is essential for the media and the “expert” in the relevant field (like economists, social scientists, and etc.) to be mindful about their responsibility of delivering a correct message and transparent image to the general public in order to prevent any further misperceptions about the effect of social inequality. Most of the negative social stigma about poor people is derived from their mental stress factor while facing the limited resources they have, which in turn, making them a risk-averse and short-term thinker (Haushofer and Fehr, 2014). If the media platform is able to expose the public to comprehend these sets of struggles the poor people encounter daily, it’s less likely one will draw the conclusion that individual failure represents the person’s characteristic.</p>
			<h6> Individuals Justifying their Systems</h6>
			<p>People who support certain extents of social inequality are not only those who come from the advantaged groups, but also some are situated in the disadvantaged group. This is an interesting phenomenon because people who understand the struggle of living through poverty are expected to seek changes of their current circumstances. One explanation Jost et al. (2002) suggests is people are motivated to believe the institutions they rely on is good, fair and legitimate. Just like people display a more favorable attitude toward the group they belong to, people also display an overall positive attitude toward the system they reside to. The underlying driving force for Jost’s system justification theory is a state of mental discomfort that describes how people rationalize their actions and experiences, which justify why some individuals accept their inferior position. According to Manstead (2018), there is a positive correlation between people’s perception of social mobility and their tolerance level of inequality. In other words, if people are optimistic regarding their opportunities to obtain higher social standing, they tend to be more tolerant of the current inequality they encountered. In fact, “American participants have been found to overestimate the degree of social mobility” (Manstead, 2018). While taking cognitive dissonance into consideration, the idealistic expectation serves as a hope that many low-income households have in order to battle through their daily struggles that put them at risk for survival. By integrating the tendency of how media portrays there are many middle classes present in the society, it is inevitable for individuals to have a more optimistic view about their future generation might also fall under the “middle class” category via the notion of hard work individuals are guaranteed to have a better life, which ensures they will continue to perform what is acceptable by the society.</p>
			<p>Some individuals may continue to persist in a defensive position about the current system given that there are instances where less privileged individuals can still acquire greater wealth and or move out of poverty through their hard work. However, it is important to consider the scarcity one society faces, such as the limited resources and wealth that are available to distribute, which constrain everyone from reaching to the top. Based on Curtis and Anderson (2015), society with less and more social inequality holds a very distinct perception about social mobility, such that in a more equal society, people understand “becoming wealthy is done at the expense of others” while in a less equal society, people believe everyone has the same opportunity to attain “greater” wealth. Building off from this distinction, the “American Dream” serves as a hypocritical notion proposed by the American authority, where it evokes an unrealistic expectation that many people look upon in order to feed in their mental cycle of accepting their current position while maintaining the status quo of social mobility.</p>
			<h6>Social Inequality Align with Individual's Self Interest</h6>
			<p>Thus far, the paper shows how both advantaged and disadvantaged groups perceive social inequality (and poverty) that end up causing them to support certain extents of social inequality. For this section, it will demonstrate how social inequality may endorse some people’s self interest. As mentioned above, the media intentionally blur the line for categorizing the majority as middle class. Not only does this constitute negative social stigma about the poor, but it also led people to believe they have higher subjective status. As a result of this higher subjective status, it reinforces individuals’ beliefs that inequality is justified (Curtis and Anderson, 2015). Because the current status quo does not have a direct impact on many privileged individuals, there is a lack of pressure to improve the social inequality issue. The lobbyists who have a considerable influence on legislation are certainly not those who will be affected by social inequality in the short run. One additional intriguing phenomenon that aligns with people’s self interest is those engaged in social comparison, the tendency to compare themselves with others who have lower social standing, and are less likely to be supportive of redistribution (Manstead, 2018). This implies a byproduct of social hierarchies is generating a sense of superiority and positive affirmation among individuals who are assigned with a higher social status because they know their status is being recognized by their surroundings and by themselves. The favorable attitude toward the hierarchy and prestigious status are indeed one main obstacle that hinder people from supporting social equality because they are unwilling to go against the societal norm and their personal interests; the notion that “this is how society has functioned throughout centuries.”</p>
			<p>Nonetheless, it is important to be aware that not all societal norms are good for individuals. The flip side of the hierarchical structure is people may undergo status anxiety (Layte and Whelan, 2014). Although this mental state is especially harmful to people living in poverty, everyone can experience status anxiety regardless of their current socioeconomic state (SES) because humans have the tendency to compare with others who are “superior” than them. Some may argue that cognitive stress is a driving force that pushes people to improve and become a more talented person. However, status anxiety is an unnecessary stress that has a multiplier effect on individuals who already have a lot of stress regarding other issues, which set them at a disadvantageous spot to engage in a “unfair” comparison with the others. For instance, by applying Shafir’s (2017) holistic approach of how he investigates poverty in contexts, it is observable that low-income households are not inherently “lazy” and or “untalented” to gain a high status standing in the merit-based environment. Rather, the constraints they encounter, including scarcity of time, money, and energy due to everyday decisions, put them at risks of worrying much more about survival rather than living with a long-term goal-oriented vision. At this point, the readers should have established a general understanding that despite the SES may establish a short term positive affirmation to individuals, SES could have a lasting negative impact on any individuals without them noticing it.</p>
			<h6>Change Individuals' Attitudes: Organized Diffusion<a href ="#reference" style="color:blue">[2]</a></h6>
			<p>After analyzing the psychological motives that lead some individuals to support social inequality, this paper will offer some suggestions on how to change such attitudes for further policy implications. A straightforward method will be establishing informational programs that distribute the appropriate message to the community based on the concept of “neo-diffusionism” such that ideas can be propagated from “one cultural agents” to another through communication (Cislaghi et al., 2019). By actively discussing the issue with the others, it’s easier for the group to establish a common ground of correcting their misperception if the programs are packaged with the right information along with an effective structure. Ideally, the message should inform how people should visualize poverty and social inequality in a holistic view of observing there are physical and mental barriers that affected individuals must face due to systematic failure and the vicious cycle the problem engaged in; rather than overgeneralizing affected individuals’ characteristics. The effective structure is “organized diffusion” coined by Cislaghi et al. (2019), where practitioners in the field (those who look to tackle issues regarding social inequality) will invade into an immediate community that has little information about how social inequality is affecting the country’s performance and inform them with the right information. After the information is exposed to a small community, they will diffuse the knowledge back to their surroundings, like their friends and family. The advantage of this structure is once the correct message is delivered and grasped by one individual, this individual will be a credible source of delivering the same message to his surrounding more effectively because people tend to relate to others who belong to their groups.</p>
			<h6>Normative Reframing<a href ="#reference" style="color:blue">[11]</a></h6>
			<p>Building off from the organized diffusion structure, the question then becomes how do the practitioners actually deliver the correct message to the individuals for them to distribute it on their own, under the assumption that system justification theory still plays a role and these individuals are still affected by their self interest. A method worth investigating is to “reconceptualize an issue in terms of an alternative existing norm,” also known as normative reframing (Raymond et al., 2014). The benefit of utilizing this method is to avoid the notion of going against a well-established societal norm. Instead, the method aims to spot the weakness of the societal norm that contributes negative consequence to the individuals and replaces it with a stronger and positive norm.</p>
			<p>As mentioned, people are mainly driven by their self-interest; thus, it is applicable to reframe a norm that will align with people’s self interest. For instance, Curtis and Anderson (2014) suggest if people think the consequence of lowering social inequality will benefit them in the economic dimension, they are more likely to support reducing social inequality despite their perception of current fairness in the society. This implies the informative program can illustrate the continuation of social inequality will have a long lasting negative impact to their country’s economy, which puts them in a disadvantaged position compared to other countries with more equitable society. The rationale is because equitable society generates an overall positive affection among the residents, which motivates them to deliver a better performance on improving the nation’s economy. Whereas, despite individuals in a less equitable society provoking themselves with an unrealistic-optimistic perspective, stress is inevitable thus can affect their performance to an extent. Here, the suggestion pinpoints the weakness of the norm regarding subjective SES status, and aims to reframe the general public to think more farsighted to construct a profitable nation for themselves and for the future generation.</p>
			<p>Some people may argue not everyone is self-interest driven, and it is important to account for this exception. The proposed solution for these individuals may replace a distinct strong-positive norm while still highlighting the same weakness regarding subjective SES status. For example, the informational program can focus on the norm of people expected to have some fairness displayed in their communities. Manstead (2018) shows by exposing the right information that “economic success is due to structural factors rather than individual effort”, it encourages participants to support government policies to reduce inequalities despite the traditional norm of opposing government intervention in American society. Because participants are now aware of one of the ingredients to become successful is individual’s privileges, it provokes a follow-up question regarding if the system is fair. Not only does this research show individual’s perceptions are not fixed and are relatively flexible when it comes to improving the society they belong to, but it also demonstrates the effectiveness of normative reframing that strong-positive norm is more appealing once they spot the weakness of the other existing negative norm.</p>
			<h6>Case Study: Climate Change</h6>
			<p>The environmental advocates use normative reframing as their strategy to gather more support from the general public to solve issues regarding climate change, and it is worthwhile to analyze this case study as a way to further evaluate the effectiveness of the method. First, the activists have reframed the climate change issues as a “fundamental violation of basic human rights since there are unequal levels of emission by wealthy and poor” (Raymond et al., 2014). The rationale behind this reframing is basic human rights is a stronger norm compared to people’s economic interest. In fact, the sense of fairness is implicitly in the reframing because the activists had exposed the general public to understand those who highly pollute the environment are the less impacted one, while those who roughly contribute to the inclination of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission are greatly impacted. The effectiveness of this reframing is a positive change regarding there are international negotiations that took place to come up with potential rules to address climate change (Raymond et al., 2014). Although the root cause of climate change is not yet resolved, by having policymakers and the general public to put this issue in the political agenda, it maintains a momentum for the nation to come up with potential solutions rather than preserving previous status quo.</p>
			<p>In order to show why climate change is an appropriate case study to generalize the intervention’s effectiveness, it is important to understand some individuals who were once denied to support fixing the issue of climate change believe their support may end up hurting their economic interest. According to Raymond et al. (2014), “American policies always gave away newly created emissions rights to existing polluters for free due to the norm of granting resource ownership based on beneficial prior use.” To an extent, polluters aren’t being punished by the state; yet, when the environmental reformers pinpoint the weakness of polluters who are contributing the inclination of GHG emissions should be punished to alleviate some of the expenses encountered by other small business owners and other parties who are contributing positive impact to the environment. Here, it shows that as long as society is able to spot the weakness of an existing norm and replace it with a better existing norm, the general public tends to shift their supportive stance toward the better existing norm.</p>
			<h1 id ="discussion"> Discussion </h1>
			<p>Throughout the article, it emphasizes on the psychological elements that hinder people to break through the status quo of social inequality, such as misperception about the poor characteristics, tendency to favor their own system, and self-interest driven. The purpose of pinpointing these psychological factors is not to discourage the negativity of humanity; rather, it seeks to raise awareness of such mental constraints embedded in people’s mind and to investigate the potential solutions of overcoming these obstacles. The proposed call to action is using the organized diffusion framework to disseminate the appropriate information to the community along with the intention to alter the negative norms by pinpointing its weakness and or replacing it with a stronger norm that generates much more positive effect to the society. Here, the intention of altering people’s attitude is to minimize the disagreement among parties that cause the stagnation of social inequality, with the hope that different parties can reach a consensus regarding a potential solution for the issue.</p>
			<p>The field of changing people’s attitude regarding complicated social issues is not a popular research topic partly because it’s very difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Normally, it will take a long time to see the consequence of intervention that aims to alter people’s attitude; thus, a traditional one-time experimental study of bringing in participants to experience through the intervention and measure the difference afterward is not applicable. Henceforth, this paper suggests launching experimental programs that can both inform the participants with the “right” message and redress the psychological barriers embedded in some individuals. In fact, the example of climate change indeed shows intervention cannot change people’s mindset immediately, but by constantly exposing the community to a set of strong-positive norms and detecting the weakness of norms that generate negative attitudes, environmentalists are able to make progress on the issue of climate change.</p>
			<p>It is important to acknowledge the limitation of the suggested call to action for addressing social inequality (by changing individual’s attitude) is there’s only minimal experiments launched in existing literature. This means it is difficult to quantify the effectiveness of this potential call to action since there are no actual experimental programs that were launched with the intention to utilize the organized diffusion structure and normative reframing strategy to affect people’s perception about social inequality. The terms are all borrowed from existing research that aim to solve different social issues, such as climate change,<a href ="#reference" style="color:blue">[11]</a> women empowerment, and health promotion.<a href ="#reference" style="color:blue">[2]</a> However, because each of these social issues have similar psychological constraints, like some individuals are unwilling to go against the norms, some misunderstand the cause of the issue, and other want to maintain status quo for their personal interest, these social issues’ potential solutions become applicable to generalize the effectiveness of the the hypothetical situation of applying the technique to social inequality.</p>
			<p>As a follow-up research that will take place in the future, with the hope to solve the issues regarding social inequality, it is worthwhile to quantify the effectiveness of the organized diffusion structure as well as the plausibility of normative reframing. One way to decide whether a proposed call to action is effective is by observing how social inequality and or poverty are portrayed in the media platform. Earlier in this paper, I mentioned that the media had intentionally blurred the line of the middle class to provoke a false image about an individual's higher subjective status as well as the availability of abundant resources for upward mobility. If the experimental program has correctly propagated the right information to the community, it will be easier to spot how these individuals respond to the media platform, such as requesting change for a more transparent image illustrated by the media and once again making the minority group visible to the general public.</p>
			<p>To wrap up this article, I want to leave a note about social issues, like inequality and poverty are not intended to be at the status quo in nature; instead, it is what society demands. Afterall, if the society has the power to maintain the status quo of social inequality, it definitely has the power to initiate some forms of change and improvement to overcome this issue and its negative byproducts, such as affecting the nation’s wealth in the long run, leaving a bad legacy to the future generation, and many more. At last, the changes will not be apparent immediately after applying some kinds of intervention because social issues require time for the right information and beliefs to disseminate. This implies patience and resilience are the key factors before one can determine that specific intervention is influential.</p>
